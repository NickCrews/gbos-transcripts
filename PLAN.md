# GBOS Meeting Transcript Database

## Context

The Girdwood Board of Supervisors (GBOS) publishes meeting recordings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOUlNInprZEjhbpVPiJOlEA) (~188 videos). There's no searchable archive of what was said, by whom, or when. This project creates an audio+transcript database with lexical and semantic search and a daily update pipeline — enabling citizens and AI agents to find when GBOS discussed any topic.

The data model is designed to be **municipality-agnostic** so additional government bodies can be added later, following the MeetingBank schema conventions where applicable.

It is also designed to be **source-agnostic**. YouTube is the only ingestion source today, but Vimeo, direct uploads, and municipality-hosted streams are all plausible tomorrow. A meeting therefore has its own internal id (`meetings.id`, the integer primary key), and the YouTube video id is just one *attribute* of that meeting (its source identifier). All downstream code — pipeline stages, cache paths, function signatures, test fixtures — should key off the internal meeting id, not the YouTube id. See "Open: source abstraction" below for the planned schema follow-up.

## Prior Art Considered

- **Council Data Project**: Open-source, Python+TS, closest match — but uses Google Cloud services and Firebase
- **MeetingBank**: Research dataset covering 6 municipalities with agenda-item-linked transcripts. Our schema follows its structure: meetings contain agenda items, agenda items contain transcript segments with timing info
- **Hamlet / OpenCouncil / Councilmatic**: Production platforms, SaaS or tightly coupled to their own infra
- **OpenWhispr**: Open-source meeting assistant using sherpa-onnx for local speaker diarization — our diarization pipeline follows their architecture

**No Python required.** All ML runs through ONNX models loaded either by `sherpa-onnx` (transcription, diarization) or `@xenova/transformers` (text embedding). The only native dependency is `ffmpeg` for audio decoding.

**Drizzle as source of truth**: The schema is defined in `web/src/db/schema.ts`. The pipeline connects to the same Postgres database using `postgres` (postgres-js) with raw SQL.

### What we add beyond MeetingBank

- **People**: Persistent speaker identity across meetings with voice embeddings
- **Voice fingerprinting**: Automatic cross-meeting speaker linking via these embeddings

## Diarization Architecture

Follows the [OpenWhispr local diarization approach](https://openwhispr.com/blog/local-speaker-diarization), implemented entirely through sherpa-onnx native Node.js bindings:

1. **Silero VAD** (~2MB) — filter silence before expensive stages
2. **pyannote-3.0 segmentation** (~6.6MB ONNX) — identify speaker boundaries and overlapping speech
3. **CAM++ embeddings** (~28MB ONNX) — 512-dim voice fingerprints per segment
4. **Agglomerative clustering** — group embeddings at 0.5 cosine-similarity threshold

Total model size: ~45MB, downloaded once via `pnpm download-models`. The only network activity after first launch is the one-time model download.

**Minimum segment duration**: 0.8 seconds for reliable CAM++ embedding extraction.

### How it works

1. **Diarization** (`pipeline/src/diarize.ts`): sherpa-onnx produces speaker embeddings per speaker (mean-pooled over their segments).

2. **Identify** (`pipeline/src/identify.ts`): For each speaker embedding, query `people` by cosine distance:

   ```sql
   SELECT id FROM people
   WHERE voice_embedding <=> $vec::vector < 0.45  -- similarity > 0.55
   ORDER BY voice_embedding <=> $vec::vector
   LIMIT 1
   ```

   Confidence tiers (matching OpenWhispr):
   - **≥ 0.70 similarity**: auto-confirm
   - **0.55–0.70**: suggest (auto-confirm for now, can add UX prompt later)
   - **< 0.55**: create new `Unknown Speaker` row

3. **Link segments**: Each aligned transcript segment gets `person_id` set to the matched or newly-created person.

4. **Manual override** (future CLI): `tsx pipeline/src/manage-people.ts name 3 "Mike Edgington"`, merge duplicates, assign roles.
